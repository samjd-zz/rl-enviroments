## Educational Use Notice

This project is intended for educational and learning purposes. The reinforcement
learning environment simulates support ticket routing scenarios and is designed to:

- Teach RL environment design principles
- Demonstrate Gymnasium API compliance
- Provide a practical example of multi-component reward functions
- Showcase test-driven development for RL systems
- Illustrate interactive visualization with Streamlit

Students, researchers, and practitioners are encouraged to:
- Study the code architecture and design patterns
- Experiment with different reward functions and configurations
- Use it as a template for building custom RL environments
- Extend it with new features and improvements
- Share improvements back with the community
